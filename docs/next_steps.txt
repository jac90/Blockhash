Current high priority TODOs:

- complete IO integration in Blktap2 for Dom0 transparent handling of IO
- test and stabilise all functionality including FSMetadata format and 
blockstore code.
- adapt code for insertion into driver domains to provide resource isolation
and direct IO handling from guest VMs.
- add clustering/remote synch capability in blockstore nodes
- API/management interfaces for blockstore nodes
